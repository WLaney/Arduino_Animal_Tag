who_am_i doesn't return a value for some reason. In standby mode, it returns 0;
outside of it, it returns 0 or 0xFF. This is true regardless of which library
we use to read the register; in fact, the Spanish library doesn't even bother
to check it.

I've seen people get the correct value (0xD7) out of the thing, so I don't know
why we can't. It's not too big an issue, but it means that we need to try a
different approach to see if we can really read from this.

- temperature sensor returns approximately correct value
- single reads
- range/ODR configuration
- burst-reading
