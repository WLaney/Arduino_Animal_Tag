# Pillaged Gyroscope Library

## Introduction
This library pillages the code from an Adafrut Gyroscope library to
reduce unneeded features and decrease memory use. It also exchanges
the existing (safe) methods for getting data with newer (unsafe)
ones.

This is a library for the Adafruit Triple-Axis Gyro sensor

Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit L3GD20/L3GD20H Breakout 
  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/1032

These sensors use I2C or SPI to communicate, 2 pins (I2C) or 4 pins (SPI) 
are required to interface.
