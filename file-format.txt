Sharkduino File Format
======================
This format holds data written from the Arduino to the SD card. It
consists of a header and alternating sections of buffered data
(accelerometer and gyroscope) and long-term data (temperature,
pressure, and time).

I'm not sure if we're going to go with the total sizes presented;
depending on how we encode or decode the data, there might be some
extra padding to make encoding and decoding easier (i.e. not require
bit-packing).

`ts`
--
The `ts` structure is used internally in ds3234.h (the RTC library we're
using) to represent time. The struct is as follows (pulled from the
source code):

```c
struct ts {
    uint8_t sec;         /* seconds */
    uint8_t min;         /* minutes */
    uint8_t hour;        /* hours */
    uint8_t mday;        /* day of the month */
    uint8_t mon;         /* month */
    int year;            /* year */
    uint8_t wday;        /* day of the week */
    uint8_t yday;        /* day in the year */
    uint8_t isdst;       /* daylight saving time */
    uint8_t year_s;      /* year in short notation*/
// we're not using unix time
#ifdef CONFIG_UNIXTIME
    uint32_t unixtime;   /* seconds since 01.01.1970 00:00:00 UTC*/
#endif
};
```
Its total size is 13 bytes.

Header
------
The header contains information that contextualizes the rest of the
data in the file. A buffered data section is guaranteed to follow it.

name            | type    | description
----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------
`magic_name`    | char[4] | A magic name: 'SHRK'
`startup_date`  | ts      | Date and time on startup
`bdata_size`    | int     | Size, in bytes, of buffered data section.
`accel_scale`   | float   | Accelerometer scale. Used to convert raw data.
`gyro_scale`    | float   | Gyroscope scale. Used to convert raw data.
   Total Size:  | 29      |

Buffered Data
-------------
This section contains a continuous stream of accelerometer and
gyroscope data. Its size can be calculated as

(number of writes per long-term write) * (size of buffer, in bytes)

A long-term data section (or EOF) is guaranteed to follow it.

name      | type  | description
----------|-------|-------------
`accel_x` | short | 
`accel_y` | short | 
`accel_z` | short | 
`gyro_x`  | short | 
`gyro_y`  | short | 
`gyro_z`  | short | 
    Total:| 12    |

The above section repeats itself (bytes in buffer / 12) times.

Long-Term Data
--------------
This section contains time, temperature, and pressure data, all of which
is infrequently read and written.

A buffered data section (or EOF) is guaranteed to follow it.

name          | type  | description
--------------|-------|-------------
`time`        | ts    |
`temperature` | float |
`pressure`    | float |
   Total Size:| 21    |
