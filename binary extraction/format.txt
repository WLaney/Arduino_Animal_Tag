I think that, for the sake of sanity, we should go with a more or less
wholly binary format. That way, we don't have to worry about parsing
binary as text or vice versa, which could quickly get annoying.

Anyway, we have four chunks to our file type: a header (gives
configuration data, specifies size of other chunks), an accelerometer
chunk (packed accel data), a gyroscope chunk (packed gyro data),
and a long-term data chunk (date/time, temperature, pressure). Some
of those chunks can be ripped from the old binary work we did.
