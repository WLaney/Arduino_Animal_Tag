Accelerometer Size: 218 bytes
Gyroscope Size: 290 bytes

Ratio: 1.33 (correct!)

Predicted Accelerometer Size:
(48 reads / 2 reads-per-pack) * 9 bytes-per-pack = 216
Where are the additional 2 bytes coming from?

Predicted Gyroscope Size:
48 reads * 3 shorts-per-read * 2 bytes-per-short = 288
Again, what of the two extra bytes?

Realized that two extra bytes were \r\n; corrected.
