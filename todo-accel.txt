Change interface:
 - To avoid cycling standby/active more than once, 
   the user should have to specify the interrupt pins on startup.
   However, they have to both specify which interrupts to enable and which pins to use.
   My current plan for this is something like:
   
     init(rate, scale, interrupt_1s, interrupt_2s)

   With the interrupts each being bitmasks. It's not elegant, and poses some problems,
   but it's the only reasonable way to do it without some unorthodox code or flipping
   the tag between standby and active multiple times.
 - Add a new private method, setupInterrupts(), to be called by the startup code.
 - Add a new enum for interrupts and pins (done).

New sketch:
 - Setup accelerometers to use dready interrupt with pin 1.
 - Setup Arduino to receive interrupt on pin 3.
 - Use interrupt-based system to this end.
